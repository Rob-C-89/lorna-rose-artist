            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a figurative portrait artist working in London. I produce work in oil paint or charcoal,
            preferring to work from life. I appreciate the versatility of oil paint in terms of mark-marking and
            usually working with a limited palette. I have trained in traditional methods of drawing and oil
            painting but like to experiment with a more contemporary style; in my self-portrait I used a
            palette knife to apply and remove paint to create areas lighter in value.
            <br> <br>
            For me, producing a portrait is a powerful way of breaking down the social-norms between an
            artist and the sitter. As we work together, a familiarity forms; our individual protective
            mechanisms fall away and we are left in intimate connected-ness. The act of producing a
            portrait allows both of us to feel less isolated and the sitter to feel more seen.</p>

            <h2>Commissions</h2>
            <p>Commissioning a portrait is a unique and exciting experience, and every commission is different. Whether you want to cherish a special moment in your loved oneâ€™s life, honour a significant figure, peer or colleague, capture your children in paint before they grow into grumpy teenagers or you just want to see what you might look like through the eyes of an artist, the process is always geared towards finding the individual character of my sitters.
            The process can vary widely, depending on the availability of the subject, the scale of the project and the purpose of the painting, and so I always recommend getting in touch with me to discuss how that might work best for you.
            Commissioned portraits start with a discussion so I can fully understand your needs and so you can understand what will be involved.
